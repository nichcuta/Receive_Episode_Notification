# Receive_Episode_Notification
Receive a notification when your new favorite Season's Release a new Episode. This is set to to check for episodes released yesterday but can be emended accordingly.

Additional Python Libraries Required: imdbpie (pip install imdbpie).

Imdb is used to get the episode list. To add new seasons, search the season on imdb and copy the ID from the URL ie: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2632424/episodes?season=2&ref_=ttep_ep_sn_nx (ID: tt2632424)

PS: One can implement the Proton-Mail script to make it send automatic emails once new Ep's are released. Additionally running the script via a cron job once a day.

Thats right about it, Hope this simple script Helps :)
